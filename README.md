# Programming Windows 5th edition source code

Source code contained in Charles Petzold's excellent [Programming Windows 5th edition](http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/). The source code is presented here for convenience (so you don't need to dig up the physical media of the book) and remains the copyright of the book authors. Consult `readme.txt` (the TXT that came with the book) for additional information.

I'm currently going through the projects one by one and fixing the compilation switches (which are generating warnings and errors), as well as retargeting and upgrading the solutions. This means old .dsw, .dsp, and .dep files are being removed. If you need these files, look at the earlier commits of this repository. Some samples, particularly in Chapter 16, no longer function due to their requirement of 256-bit display pallete.
