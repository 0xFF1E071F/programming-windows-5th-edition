# Programming Windows 5th edition source code

Source code contained in Charles Petzold's excellent [Programming Windows 5th edition](http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/). The source code is presented here for convenience (so you don't need to dig up the physical media of the book) and remains the copyright of the book authors. Consult `readme.txt` (the TXT that came with the book) for additional information.

I'm currently going through the projects one by one and fixing the compilation switch warnings. These warnings were not added by me, but are due to the project files being dated.
